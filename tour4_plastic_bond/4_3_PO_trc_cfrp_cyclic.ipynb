Since this is the case, the conclusion can be made, that the bond behavior in the tested TRC specimens is primarily governed by plasticity.\n",

The non-linear shape of the experimentally obtained curve cannot be reproduced in a better way. **Non-linear hardening** function instead of a single hardening modulus $\\gamma$ can be theoretically included into the framework of plasticity. However, such enhancement requires a non-trivial systematic calibration procedure which would be able to uniquely associate the inelastic mechanisms governing the response to the hardening process, which is a non-trivial task. Such effort would only be justified for a material combination with large amount of practical applications. "

On the other hand, in the case of [CFRP test](cfrp_test) governed by softening, the debonded zone reaches zero stress level and does not contribute to stress transfer any more. As a result, the effective length of the bond zone becomes shorter, so that the structural stiffness upon unloading must be smaller than the initial stiffness.\n",
