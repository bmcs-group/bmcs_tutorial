    "Let us assume that the fracture energy $G_\\mathrm{f}$ is known and  we want to improve the above model to deliver stable, mesh-independent results. Knowing that the energy dissipation is only happening in the one softening element, we can require that it alwas dissipates the same amount of energy. Recall that the fracture energy dissipated by a unit area of a stress free crack is evaluated as \n",

Thus, the softening is not related to crack opening displacement (COD) but to a strain in the softening zone using a softening function $\\phi(\\varepsilon_\\mathrm{s})$. This model was used in the example above and delivered mesh-dependent results with varying amount of fracture energy.\n",
